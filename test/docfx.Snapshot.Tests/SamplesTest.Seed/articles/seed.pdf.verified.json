This includes runtime code changes, unit test updates, and\ndeployment scripts. For example, sending a PR for just an update to a unit test might seem like a\nwaste of time but the unit tests are just as important as the product code and as such, reviewing\nchanges to them is also just as important.\nThe advantages are numerous: improving code quality, more visibility on changes and their\npotential impact, avoiding duplication of effort, and creating general awareness of progress\nbeing made in various areas.\nIn general a PR should be signed off(using the \uD83D\uDC4D emoticon) by the Owner of that code.\nTo commit the PR to the repo do not use the Big Green Button. Instead, do a typical push that\nyou would use with Git (e.g. local pull, rebase, merge, push).\nSource Code Management\nBranch strategy\nIn general:\nmaster has the code for the latest release on NuGet.org. (e.g. 1.0.0, 1.1.0)\ndev has the code that is being worked on but not yet released. This is the branch into which\ndevs normally submit pull requests and merge changes into. We run daily CI towards dev\nbranch and generate pre-release nuget package, e.g. 1.0.1-alpha-9-abcdefsd.\nhotfix has the code for fixing master bug after it is released. hotfix changes will be merged\nback to master and dev once it is verified.\nSolution and project folder structure and naming\nSolution files go in the repo root. The default entry point is All.sln.\nEvery project also needs a project.json and a matching .xproj file. This project.json is the\nsource of truth for a project's dependencies and configuration options.\nSolution need to contain solution folders that match the physical folder (src, test, tools, etc.).\nAssembly naming pattern",

This will help ensure that the standard is\nfollowed by all developers on the team in a consistent manner.\n\"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code\nthat humans understand\".\nMartin Fowler. Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code.\nPurpose\nThe aim of this section is to define a set of C# coding standards to be used by CAPS build team to\nguarantee maximum legibility, reliability, re-usability and homogeneity of our code. Each section\nis marked Mandatory or Recommended. Mandatory sections, will be enforced during code\nreviews as well as tools like StyleCop and FxCop, and code will not be considered complete until it\nis compliant.\nScope\nThis section contains general C# coding standards which can be applied to any type of\napplication developed in C#, based on Framework Design Guidelines\uF1C5 .\nIt does not pretend to be a tutorial on C#. It only includes a set of limitations and\nrecommendations focused on clarifying the development.\nTools\nResharper\uF1C5 is a great 3rd party code cleanup and style tool.\nStyleCop\uF1C5 analyzes C# srouce code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules and has\nbeen integrated into many 3rd party development tools such as Resharper.\nFxCop\uF1C5 is an application that analyzes managed code assemblies (code that targets the .NET\nFramework common language runtime) and reports information about the assemblies, such\nas possible design, localization, performance, and security improvements.\nC# Stylizer\uF1C5 does many of the style rules automatically\nHighlights of Coding Standards\nThis section is not intended to give a summary of all the coding standards that enabled by our\ncustomized StyleCop, but to give a highlight of some rules one will possibly meet in daily coding",
